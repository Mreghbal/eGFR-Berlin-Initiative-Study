# eGFR-Berlin-Initiative-Study
Here's a complete Python code for calculating Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the Berlin Initiative Study (BIS) equation:
This code defines a function calculate_egfr that takes age, gender, serum creatinine, and race as input parameters and returns the calculated eGFR value. The main part of the code prompts the user to enter the required input values, calls the calculate_egfr function, and prints the result. It also includes exception handling to handle invalid input values.

Please note that this code uses the Berlin Initiative Study (BIS) equation for estimating GFR and assumes a serum creatinine unit of mg/dL. Additionally, the race adjustment factor is provided by the user depending on whether the patient is black or non-black.

Feel free to modify the code as per your specific requirements and guidelines.
